The Grail Quest

The cup, after catching the blood of Christ, after being used by the Buddha and Muhammad, made its way to the Abbey of whatever, until being reclaimed by the Knights Templar (Landry) in 1305, whereupon it was given to the Pope.  It then disappeared and has been lost since.

What really happened was the cup was placed in a middle-of-nowhere inn, mixed in with the other common cups, and for the time that it was there those who drank from it enjoyed unusual good health.  Then, one day, a careless barmaid broke the grail into three pieces, and it was tossed into the midden.

That was a few hundred years ago.  Recently the inn burned to the ground...no.  It was a few decades ago, and the inn has since become a prominent waystation on the road to a holy site, a temple where paladins were martyred.

Okay, so the main issue here is in trying to figure out why fragments of a cup would be useful to anyone, of interest to anyone.  The cup itself is terra cotta or some other kind of unfinished pottery, no valuable materials there.  Once it's broken, it's garbage, right?

Perhaps a priest happened to be staying in the inn, and God gave him a dream about the grail in the middens.  The priest recovered the fragments and placed them in a strongbox in his carriage, but the carriage was beset by bandits, the PILGRIMAGE was beset by bandits on its way to the holy site.  The strongbox was broken open in the struggle and two of the three fragments were scopped up by the bandits with the rest of the loot.

So why wouldn't the bandits have tossed the fragments?  Probably because each of the three fragments has the ancient holy symbol (ichthys?) carved into it, faint, very worn, but still barely legible.  One of the bandits recognized this and opted to donate one of the fragments as a relic to his local church, in exchange for indulgence.  He intended to sell the other fragment but was ultimately murdered by the Brotherhood of Light, who claimed it and are now on the trail of the rest.

Meanwhile the pope has dispatched paladins to track down the other fragments.  And a local lord with designs on power has reclaimed the third piece from the small church, and has dispatched his own men to find the rest.  Finally there is a fourth party involved, agents of the Dark One who seek to claim the grail to perform their own dark ritual.

This campaign can be played by agents of any of the four authorities.
