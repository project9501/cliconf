### The Primals

The oldest figures, called the Primals, the Elder Spirits, Aeons, or the Endless, are the archetypes that shape the thoughts of God.  They were first conceived of as taking the form of animals that embodied the archetype they were associated with, and named as such by the mortals of the First Aeon.  Their "realness" is in Dreams, though they can often be found in the Real.
