Cosmic Evil

The Archons are a manifestation of the Shadow, the flaw in the cosmos.  

Evil is a concept invented by humans, to mean "that which is opposed to the good of humanity."  (It has other potential meanings but they all generally fall within a standard deviation of this one.)

Humans tend to view the cosmos from a humanistic perspective, which, incidentally, is what I will assert is the "correct" perspective.

The Archons are in opposition to the good of humanity.

Ergo, since the Archons are fundamental to the cosmos, and the Archons are in opposition to humanity, it is not inaccurate to shorthand the Archons as "cosmic evil" or "fundamental evil."
