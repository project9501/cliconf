Overview

* The Cosmos, the Real, was created when it came to know itself among the ever-swirling chaos of the Beyond
* The Primals are the archetypes within the Cosmos, embodied
* * Primals have no ability to change or vary; they are static representations of their archetype
* * This is not to say they aren't viewed differently by the mortals who worship them
* The Phoenix is the greatest of the Primals
* Angels are like an immune system, who keep things running smoothly
* An anti-Cosmos also emerged, called the Shadow
* The two are anathema; they corrode and corrupt each other
* The fae were created as servitors to the Primals, whereas the mortals were created to carry thoughts
* Each time the mortals eventually discovered the nature of reality, which led them to blend with the overmind
* The Dreaming is the mind's dreams, the Feywild is their imagination, whimsy, and terror
* The Maelstrom is simply the Beyond, possibilities coalescing into brief elemental forms before becoming lost
* * The City of Brass, such as it is, is within the Feywild
* Mortals are thoughts given life by the Wellspring, the Cosmos knowing itself
* * They are blessed with *anam*, souls, fragments of the eternal

* The Ancients were the third race, who achieved Enlightenment
* Some of the Ancients became aware of the Shadow as they explored all that was
* The Real is orderly, the Shadow is chaotic; the Real is pleasant, the Shadow is hateful
* The Ancients locked up the Nightmares before they could achieve their goals
* But the Nightmares were eventually freed as the Dhaosen began to Awaken
* They were able to draw the Shadow into the Real, corrupting the Phoenix and creating the Red Star
* Now there are demons, who may only act in the Real when attached to a mortal
* They must be able to manipulate a mortal's *anam*; they have no form otherwise
* This is also when the first angels were created, as an "immune" function for the overmind
* * Angels are the wheels-and-wings variety unless housed, which they don't need but makes them much stronger
* Demons are from the anti-realm; they are like the "angels" of floraverse, but can possess
* * An unhoused demon appears like a cloud of horrors, but has no tangible form
* Devils are made by the overmind, second-guessing; they tempt and punish as needed -- "honeypots" for demonologists
* * Devils appear as their prey expect, beautiful or monstrous
