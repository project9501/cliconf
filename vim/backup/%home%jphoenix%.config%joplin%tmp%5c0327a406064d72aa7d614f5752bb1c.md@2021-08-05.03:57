What is a Paladin?

A paladin is prepared to sacrifice their life in the defense of the innocent or the fulfillment of their oath.

Must a paladin swear an oath?  Oathsworn?

A paladin has to be "good."  What does "good" mean in this context?

A paladin must oppose oppression, but not oppression of the oppressors.  So long as there are oppressors, there must always be oppression.

This is why we need the word "evil."  We need to define some behaviors as acceptable and others as not.  Not all oppression is evil -- but all evil is oppressive.

So what more is there?

A spiritual component?  Can you have a purely secular paladin?

A commitment to ideals, before all else?

But what ideals?  Are they the same for every paladin?  Probably not.

Are you on the side of the universe?  Of life?  Of human life?  Of American life?  Are you on the side of an ideal?  All depends on this -- "good" and "evil" are shorthand ways of saying "for" and "against" one's point of view.

A classical paladin is, of course, drawn from a Christian framework.  Nevertheless I think "Saracen Chivalry" contains a lot of good ideas/principles.  I should reread that book, actually.  But as a concept, like -- the Light in WoW is ... not explicitly Christian but explicitly spiritual, the religion is all about helping others, striving to make the world a better place for everyone.  

Of course, this isn't something that can be achieved through individual action.  

I think something that gets lost is the striving to set a good example.  A paladin is the embodiment of the "be the change you wish to see in the world" adage, to lead by example, to inspire others to act similarly.  Being a paladin is inherently a social practice.  It also suggests ...

So I had the thought last night that it's perhaps informative to view "alignment" through a subjective lens -- that alignment depends more on one's relationship to one's cultural ideals and traditions than it does to some absolute concept of good or law or what have you.  D&D can get away with asserting those principles because it's made by white people for white people with white perspectives, but that's the "ocean bias."  I ... don't know that this is necessarily helpful.  

"Lawful" can mean "I believe the world is a better place when everybody follows the rules," but what rules?  Meh.

So a paladin is a) someone who is devoted to a set of ideals to the point that they're willing to give their lives for those ideals (Lawful); and b) someone who lives those ideals publicly in order to set a good example for others.  

"Lawful" can mean one of the following
- Law-abiding
- Holds the belief that following the rules is what is best
- Sticks to a personal code no matter what

"Chaotic" can mean one of the following:
- Law-flouting
- Holds the belief that doing what one wants is what is best
- Has no personal code; mercurial

On the subject of "True Evil"

I believe if something can be said to cause unjust suffering, it can be said to be evil.

What is "just" suffering?  Pain suffered to learn a lesson, perhaps.  But consider the "lesson" that "you don't fuck with me;" is that "just?"  

Are there demons to slay?  If so, what is their nature?  Those creatures who inflict torment to feed themselves?
