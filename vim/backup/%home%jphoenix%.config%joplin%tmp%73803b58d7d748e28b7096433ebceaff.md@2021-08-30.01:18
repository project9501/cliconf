The Grail Quest

Apparently I forgot to save this the last time I wrote it.

So the Grail was hidden in an inn after being found by Landry in 1306.  It was used there with the other cookwear for decades, where those who drank from it enjoyed unusual good health, until a careless barmaid broke it into three pieces.  It was discarded in the middens.

The nearby abbey was ransacked by marauders in 1331, and became a pilgrimage site.  The inn grew in importance and prominence as a waystation for pilgrims.  One night in 1373, a traveling monk was given a vision of the grail lying in the middens.  He claimed the pieces, adding them to the reliquary but telling no one.

On their return from the pilgrimage, the caravan was attacked by marauders and the reliquary looted along with the coin box.  One of the pieces of the grail was sold to a small church in the hinterlands.  Another was claimed by the Brotherhood of Light.  The third made its way to Rome and was given over to the Pope.

Three fragments:
	* The first piece, the one that was not claimed by the bandits, was taken to Rome and given to the Pope.  It is the smallest fragment, a triangular piece of the bowl with the ancient holy sign faintly visible inscribed on it.  The bearer has a permanent **sanctuary** cast upon him.
	* The second piece, taken by the bandits, was claimed by a man named Ulf as spoils.  He sold it to the abbess of a splinter church, the Abbey of St Hild, who hold it still.  It is another triangular piece of the bowl.  The bearer has a permanent *shield of faith* cast upon them.
	* The final piece, also taken by the bandits, was claimed by a man named Cnut as spoils.  Cnut promptly lost it to Ragnvald at gaming.  Ragnvald held it until killed in a raid, whereupon it was claimed by Skeld.  Skeld sold it to a Saracen merchant, who ended up selling it to the Brotherhood of Light (unknowingly).  This piece contains the base and almost half the bowl.  The bearer is under the effect of a permanent *protection from good and evil*.

The search for the Grail has begun, with six interested parties:

	* The Templars were sent by the Pope to retrieve the other fragments.  They are the only party involved who formally know that there are only three fragments.
	* The Brotherhood of Light seeks the remaining fragments, to keep the Grail safe.  They know that it was sold to them by a Dane named Skeld but do not know how many other pieces there are.
	* A satanic cult within the church has learned of the existence of the Grail and seeks it for their own perverse purposes.  They know there are three pieces but not where the other two are.
	* An ambitious antipope also has leared that the Grail has been found, and has dispatched his men in search of it.  They have only rumor that it was found in pieces in the middens at the inn.
	* The King of England has heard rumors and is making inquiries in France about the Grail.  If he claims it, it will lend legitimacy to his war against France.
	* The King of France, or his majordomo, seeks the Grail as well, to secure France's primacy.

I suppose rulers from other, lesser countries might also be interested in order to increase their own station, but these are the six major players with sufficient influence and resources to make a serious go of it.  Other pretenders can emerge as momentary threats but it is highly unlikely that they will prevail.

The party that has all three fragments must then mend the Grail, which will require quests for the sacred materials: resin from a tree that once sheltered Christ, gold from the Second Temple, and brushes crafted from the reeds where Moses was placed in the Nile.  There are sages who can tell of this located in monasteries throughout Europe.

If someone has one piece they benefit from a constant *bless* effect in addition to the specific spell of the piece.  With two pieces they also gain benefit of *aid*, and with all three *crusader's mantle*.  Once the Grail has been remade it grants a permanent *aura of life* and *aura of purity* centered on itself.

Those who drink from the remade Grail receive benefit of a *lesser restoration* and *cure wounds* cast at 2nd level.  If used to serve Communion, those who drink instead receive a *heal* spell.  There is a secret ritual that allows the cup to cast a *resurrection* spell.
