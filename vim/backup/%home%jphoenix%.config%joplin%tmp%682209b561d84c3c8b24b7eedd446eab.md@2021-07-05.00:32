What is a Paladin?

A paladin is prepared to sacrifice their life in the defense of the innocent or the fulfillment of their oath.

Must a paladin swear an oath?  Oathsworn?

A paladin has to be "good."  What does "good" mean in this context?

A paladin must oppose oppression, but not oppression of the oppressors.  So long as there are oppressors, there must always be oppression.

This is why we need the word "evil."  We need to define some behaviors as acceptable and others as not.  Not all oppression is evil -- but all evil is oppressive.
