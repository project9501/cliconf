Stargate

An alien probe crash-lands on Earth.  Within it are the instructions for building a stargate.  Unfortunately the gate, when in operation, will produce extreme amounts of radiation.  A solution is eventually hit upon -- build it on the moon.  Plans are laid, a moon base is built, and the stargate is constructed.

One slight problem - the probe was sent by a belligerent, conquering species who are looking for resources and slaves.  The invaders storm through the gate, quickly taking control of the moon base and beginning to construct a staging area for the invasion of Earth.  Within hours, Earth's defenses are in tatters.

The governments of the world decide that we must recruit allies from among the more advanced races.  Fortunately, a second, backup stargate had been built, but has to be reprogrammed.  Our heroes have to infiltrate the invaders' base and download a copy of their address book, then go through the second gate which has been reprogrammed to lead to a more neutral location.  The second gate is destroyed by the invaders immediately after the party makes their way through.

Problems with this premise:

* The aliens have a murky motivation.  Invading planets to steal their resources is way harder than just pulling them off comets and asteroids.  Unless they're basically space vampires, and need "life" to feed themselves.  Either that, or it's an Independence Day situation, with a race of alien locusts who need to keep hopping planets to stay alive.  Trouble with this is, the probe would take millennia to move from one place to the next.
* The exact science of the stargate has to be worked out.  How much power does it take?  Which end provides the power?
